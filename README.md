An application which displays recipes and ingredients. 
Developed following strict TDD and SOLID conventions with loosely coupled classes. Also set up for auto config with the help of CIRCLECI.

Mainly worked on the project to get familiar with SpringData and SpringMVC(along with JUnit5). Many more updates to come.
